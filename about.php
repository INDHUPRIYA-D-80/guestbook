    <form><p><h3><strong>Things to consider when deciding on a guest book</strong><br></h3><b>WEDDING THEME</b><br>
    Classic. Fairytale. Bohemian. Rustic. Travel. Outdoors. Whatever your theme, you can accentuate it with a creative guest book! This is a perfect way to create a keepsake that evokes the overall style from your wedding. A Cornhole game for an outdoor themed wedding or a globe with a travel or destination theme.</p>

    <p><h3>SHARED HOBBIES</h3>
Put an emphasis on a hobby the two of you enjoy together. This can add a personal detail to the wedding. Allowing your guests to get to know more about you, how you met or something that stands out in your relationship. If you share a love for music, have your guests sign an old record or a concert poster. Maybe you love cooking together, collect your guests’ favorite recipes!

A traditional guest book is well known and easy to understand. Guests know what to expect and how to write a note or their name. If you want to add an entertaining element, a polaroid photo book or recorded voicemails are fun interactive ideas. Guests may need a little liquid courage, but they are going to be memories to cherish for sure! Keep your guests in mind with these types, and if it’s something they will participate in because you want to get everyone’s involvement!
